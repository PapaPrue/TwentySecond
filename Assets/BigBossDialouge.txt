Nothing out of the ordinary today, just do your job and make me moolah.
A load of Fat Cats coming up. They may be annoying, but they being me the mon-ay!
UGH, every inspector is here! I don't get it, using soap isn't that important!
Delivery time. Get the orders in ASAP, I don't want to pay the drivers extra.
"Oh sweeeeet money... HEY! Don't ease up. More is on the way"
"What's going on?! Everyone's going feral and I'm out of my sweet cash! You're fired!"
"Good job sport! We'll discuss my- I mean your pay in a bit."
