This game was made for the 2023 30 Second Game Jam. It's a Free Web based game that gained a bit of traction throughout the jam. I am releasing the code and assets as the game was free. The Second of the SquirellyBeans games, this one I am much more proud of, which can be atrributed to having more time and familiarity with the Unity system.
